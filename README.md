This repository used Orca-Spot from Bergler et al to detect and classify minke whale calls
This repository used Orca-Spot from Bergler et al to detect and classify minke whale calls. For the original code please visit https://github.com/ChristianBergler/ORCA-SPOT .
The paper to Orca-Spot can be found under this link https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-47335-w .
Orca-Spot is  a CNN with a ResNet architecture which was originally used for Orca call detection. In this repository there is a code for transforming minke whale annotations into data that can be used with Orca-Spot.
Furthermore two models are provided which are trained on minke whale calls. The MS-all-2048 is a model trained on two dataset, while the model MS-USA is only trained on a dataset from the USA.
